Created this because I wanted keep track of my records. Also when buying new records I had to make sure I did not have that album or song already. With this I could solve my issues easily.

If I want to listen to a certain song I can just write it's name on the search and then easily find it from my by genre organized self of albums.

Old version of the site can be found here: https://r3ne.net/records/old/
Current version here https://r3ne.net/records/

Created a new site since I use it mostly on mobile and the old one was not so responsive on mobile.
