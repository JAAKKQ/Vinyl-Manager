Created this because I wanted keep track of my records. Also when buying new records I had to make sure I did not have that album or song already. With this I could solve my issues easily.

If I want to listen to a certain song I can just write it's name on the search and then easily find it from my by genre organized shelf of albums.

Old version of the site can be found here: https://karkkainen.net/records/old/
Current version here https://karkkainen.net/records/

Created a new site since I use it mostly on mobile and the old one was not so responsive on mobile.

Some images may not load on first page load since there can be many records and Discogs servers are rate limiting.
Once the images are saved on user's browser cache the page will work great.
